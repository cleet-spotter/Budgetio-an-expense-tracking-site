<div class="arc">
    <p>
        In this developing world, you need to be skilled, smart to make money and enjoy life. Investment is one of the smartest ways of earning. Investment is a essential part of wealth creation. It helps you beat inflation, fulfill your financial goals, and stabilize your financial future. Instead of letting money lie idle in your bank accounts, you can in different avenues like stocks, equities, mutual funds, and fixed deposits. Think of various types of investments as tool that can help you achieve your financial goals. Each broad investment –from bank products to stocks and bonds- has its own general way of features and ways in which they can be used by investors. With many investment plans available in the market, choosing the right one could be challenging. <br>
        Listed below are a few types of investment plans that can help grow savings.<br>
       <h2> Stocks</h2>
        When you invest in a stock, you become one of the owners of a corporation. Stocks represent ownership shares, also known as equity shares. Whether you make or lose money on a stock depends on the success or failure of the company, which type of stock you own, and what’s going on in the stock market overall and other factors. Stocks and stock mutual funds often can be an important component of a diversified investment portfolio. Stocks represent a share of ownership in a company or a entity. Stocks are one of the best investment avenues for long-terms investors to earn generous returns. However, since these are market linked instruments, there is always the risk of capital loss.
        <h2>Mutual Funds and ETFs</h2>   
        Mutual funds are investment tools managed by fund manager. He pool people’s money and invest in stocks and bonds of different companies to yield returns even when starting with a smaller initial deposit amount. Investment funds pool the money of many investors and invest according to a specific strategy. Funds come in various types, each with differing features. Generally, publicly offered funds — such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts — must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as investment companies. Private investment funds (often called hedge funds) are often exempt from registration. Funds can offer diversification and professional management — and they can feature a wide variety of investment strategies and styles. As with any security, investing in a fund involves risk, including the possibility that you may lose money. And how a fund performed in the past is not an indication of how it will perform in the future. Some funds, such as hedge funds, do not register their shares with the SEC. This means they are not subject to the same regulatory standards that apply to mutual funds and other funds registered with the SEC.
        <h2>Bonds</h2>
        A bond is a loan an investor makes to a corporation, government, federal agency or other organization in exchange for interest payments over a specified term plus repayment of principal at the bond’s maturity date. There are a wide variety of bonds including Treasuries, agency bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and more. Likewise, there are many types of bonds mutual funds. When you invest in bonds and bond mutual funds, you face the risk that your investment might lose money, especially if you bought an individual bond and want or need to sell it before it matures. And bond mutual fund prices can fluctuate, just as stock mutual funds do. Risk will also vary depending on the type of bond you own. Bonds and bond mutual funds often can be an important component of a diversified investment portfolio.
        <h2>Bank Products</h2>
        Banks and credit unions can provide a safe and convenient way to accumulate savings—and some banks offer services that can help you manage your money. Deposits at banks and most credit unions are federally insured up to a limit set by Congress. And transaction (or checking) accounts and deposit accounts offer liquidity, making it easy for you to get to your funds for any reason—from day-to-day expenses to a down payment or money for unexpected emergencies. In addition to being insured by the FDIC, checking accounts let you transfer money by check or electronic payment to a person or organization that you designate as payee. But remember, the interest you earn from bank products—including certificates of deposit (CDs)—tends to be lower than potential returns from other investments.
        <h2>Options</h2>
        Options are contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security, such as a stock or exchange-traded fund, at a fixed price within a specific period of time. Options can help investors manage risk. But buying and selling options also involves risk, and it is possible to lose money. It pays to learn about different types of options, trading strategies and the risks involved.
        <h2>Annuities</h2>
        An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which the company promises to make periodic payments to you, starting immediately or at some future time. You buy an annuity either with a single payment or a series of payments called premiums. Some annuity contracts provide a way to save for retirement. Others can turn your savings into a stream of retirement income. Still others do both. If you use an annuity as a savings vehicle and the insurance company delays your pay-out to the future, you have a deferred annuity. If you use the annuity to create a source of retirement income and your payments start right away, you have an immediate annuity. The two most common types of annuities are fixed and variable. There is also a hybrid called an indexed annuity, also referred to as an equity-indexed annuity or a fixed-index annuity. Variable annuities are securities and under FINRA's jurisdiction. Annuities are often products investors consider when they plan for retirement—so it pays to understand them. They also are often marketed as tax-deferred savings products. Annuities come with a variety of fees and expenses, such as surrender charges, mortality and expense risk charges and administrative fees. Annuities also can have high commissions, reaching seven percent or more.


        <h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
        Digital assets like cryptocurrencies and ICOs continue to evolve and spark interest from Main Street investors. With billions of dollars raised in ICO financings and over a thousand different cryptocurrencies currently available, these rapidly changing markets are tempting for investors. It is also difficult for most individual investors to make sense of these complex investment products and to determine the risk levels associated with them. A cryptocurrency is a digital representation of a stored value secured through cryptography. Although Bitcoin might be one of the most widely known cryptocurrencies today, there are many others. The markets for cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile and risky. Before turning your hard-earned cash into crypto, use the resources below from FINRA and other regulatory authorities to learn more about these markets and products.
        <h2>Insurance</h2>
        Life insurance products are often a part of an overall financial plan. They come in various forms, including term life, whole life and universal life policies. There also are variations on these—variable life insurance and variable universal life insurance—which are considered securities and must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). FINRA has jurisdiction over the investment professionals and firms that sell variable life and variable universal life products. Insurance products often are developed to meet specific objectives. For example, long-term care insurance is designed to help manage health care expenses as you age.  As with other financial products, insurance products can be complex and come with fees, so it pays to do your homework before you buy.
        <h2>Fixed deposit</h2>
        Fixed deposit is an ideal investment tool for risk-averse investors. An FD bears no effect of the market movement while offering secured returns on your deposit. Even investors with high- risk appetites choose to invest in FDs to stabilize their portfolios.


        <h2>Senior citizen saving scheme</h2>
        Senior citizen saving scheme (SCSS) is a long-term saving option for retirees. Senior citizens can invest in a lump sum in the scheme, individually or jointly, and get access to regular income along with tax benefits. This option is ideal for those who aim to create a steady and secure income stream post-retirement. 
        <h2>Public provident fund</h2>
        PPF is a trusted investment plan in India. Investments start at just Rs.500 per annum and principal invested, interest earned, and maturity amount are all exempt from tax. It has a lock-in period of 15 years, with partial withdrawals allowed at various points.
